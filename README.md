# Hi, I'm Aloko Mayowa Daniel 👋

I'm a passionate data science enthusiast with a background in civil engineering. My journey into the world of data science began during my undergraduate studies, where I explored soil behavior and strength through predictive modeling. Since then, I've been diving deeper into data analysis, machine learning, and visualization.

## 🔭 What I'm Currently Working On
- Building predictive models for real-world problems.
- Exploring new datasets and extracting insights.

## 🌱 What I'm Learning
- Advanced machine learning techniques.
- Cloud computing and big data tools.

## 💬 Ask Me About
- Data analysis.
- Python programming.
- Soil mechanics (yes, even that!).
